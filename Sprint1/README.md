# Sprint 1 – Foundations of Data Science

## Overview

Sprint 1 marks the beginning of the Data Science undergraduate program. In this phase, we covered core technological foundations, introductory programming with Python, and essential practices for collaboration and organization using version control and agile methodologies.

## Technological Foundations

In this subject, we explored essential concepts that support data science work, especially in understanding how computers process information at a low level:

- **Number Systems**:  
  Introduction to key numeric systems used in computing:
  - **Binary**: Base-2 system, fundamental to how computers operate.
  - **Decimal**: Base-10 system, used in everyday life.
  - **Hexadecimal**: Base-16 system, useful for representing binary data in a compact form.

- **Logic Gates**:  
  Understanding the building blocks of digital circuits:
  - Logic gates such as **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, **XOR**, and combinations.
  - Practical applications in simple digital circuit construction.

These concepts provide a foundation for understanding how hardware operates and how computers handle logic and data at the most basic level.

## Python Programming

During this sprint, we began developing computational thinking through the Python programming language, widely used in data science. The following topics were covered:

- **Development Environment**:  
  Setting up the environment using VSCode and/or Jupyter Notebook. Running scripts, reading error messages, and testing code interactively.

- **Syntax and Basic Structure**:  
  - Variable declaration.
  - Primitive types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`.
  - Comments and proper indentation.

- **Operators**:  
  - Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`.
  - Relational: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
  - Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`.

- **Conditional Statements**:  
  Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making and controlling the flow of the program.

- **Loops**:  
  - `for`: Iterating over sequences and collections.
  - `while`: Repeating operations based on conditions.
  - Flow control with `break` and `continue`.

- **Functions**:  
  - Defining functions using `def`.
  - Using parameters and return values.
  - Understanding variable scope and writing reusable code.

- **Collections**:  
  - Lists: Creating, indexing, and using methods like `append`, `remove`, `sort`.
  - Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, accessing and modifying data.
  - Tuples and sets: Differences and appropriate use cases.

The goal was to develop basic programming logic and solve simple problems using clean and structured code, which will serve as a foundation for more complex applications in data analysis.

## Version Control and Agile Methodologies

This part of the sprint introduced tools and practices that enable collaborative and organized work in programming projects.

### Git and GitHub

- **Introduction to Git**:  
  Understanding version control and its importance in software and data projects.

- **Basic Workflow**:
  - Initializing repositories (`git init`).
  - Staging and committing changes (`git add`, `git commit`).
  - Pushing code to remote repositories (`git push`).
  - Pulling updates from remote repositories (`git pull`).

- **GitHub**:
  - Creating remote repositories.
  - Uploading and managing code online.
  - Tracking history and collaborating with others.

Git was the main tool used to document individual progress and manage project files during this sprint.

### Agile Methodologies

- **Scrum**:
  - Introduction to key roles and events: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum.
  - Organizing tasks in a backlog and delivering in short, iterative cycles.

- **Kanban**:
  - Visualizing task progress with boards.
  - Tools like Trello were used to track ongoing activities and responsibilities.

These practices help to break down projects into smaller, manageable parts, promoting structure, focus, and continuous improvement.
